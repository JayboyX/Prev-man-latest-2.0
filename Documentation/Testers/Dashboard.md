# RailTrack Project Guide: Understanding the Dashboard

## What is RailTrack?

RailTrack is a user-friendly web tool designed to help manage and simulate railway operations. Imagine it as a digital control center for keeping track of trains and rail systems. Currently, it's in its early stages, like a blueprint, where we've built the basic layout. The Dashboard is your starting point, providing a clear and organized way to explore the tool.

## Feature: Dashboard

### What It Does

The Dashboard, also known as the "Simulation Dashboard," is the main screen you see when you open RailTrack. It's where you'll eventually control and watch train simulations. For now, it's like the foundation of a houseâ€”everything is set up, but the furniture (like train data and controls) isn't in place yet. It's designed to be easy to use, with a side menu for navigation and a large area for displaying information.

### Why It Matters

The Dashboard is your central hub. It helps you:

* **Find your way around:** A menu lets you easily navigate to different sections of RailTrack, such as simulations or reports.
* **Stay organized:** It's designed to adapt to any screen size, whether you're using a computer or tablet.
* **Get ready for future features:** It's the foundation for adding exciting functionalities like train tracking and rail health monitoring.

### How It Looks

The Dashboard consists of two main parts:

**1. Side Menu (Sidebar):**

* Located on the left side of the screen and remains visible.
* Displays the RailTrack logo (a train icon) and the name "JustRail" at the top.
* Features a list of options organized into two groups:
    * **Main:** Links to "Simulation" (your current location), "Analytics," and "Visualization" for running simulations, viewing data, and exploring maps.
    * **Tools:** Links to "Maintenance" and "Reports" for managing repairs and generating summaries (coming soon).
* Each option includes a small icon (like a gear or chart) and changes color when selected.
* Can be minimized to a thin strip by clicking the three-line button (hamburger menu) to maximize screen space.
* Displays "Justice" as the Administrator with a blue "J" circle at the bottom.

**2. Main Area:**

* Occupies the majority of the screen and adjusts its size when the side menu is minimized or expanded.
* Features a white bar at the top with the title "Simulation Dashboard."
* Next to the title, there is a placeholder for a calendar (for date selection) and a bell icon for notifications (currently inactive).
* The remaining space is currently empty, reserved for displaying train information, maps, or controls in the future.

### What You Can Do Now

In this early version, you can:

* **Explore the layout:** Click on the side menu options to familiarize yourself with the future navigation.
* **Minimize the menu:** Use the three-line button to shrink or expand the menu and observe the smooth animation.
* **Visualize the layout:** Get a sense of how RailTrack will appear on different screen sizes.
